 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
To prioritize the tasks based on dependencies and critical path, you will need to analyze the relationships between tasks and identify which tasks are dependent on others for completion. Tasks that are on the critical path are those that, if delayed, would directly impact the overall project timeline. 

Start by identifying all the tasks required to implement each user story. Then, determine which tasks are dependent on others and cannot start until the prerequisite tasks are completed. These dependent tasks should be prioritized accordingly to ensure smooth progress.

Next, identify the critical path by determining the sequence of tasks that must be completed on time to prevent delays in the project timeline. Tasks on the critical path should be given the highest priority to ensure that the project stays on track.

By prioritizing tasks based on dependencies and critical path, you can ensure that the development process is efficient and that potential delays are minimized.

 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
The original prompt was: To document the development tasks and outcomes for future reference, follow these steps:

1. Review each user story to identify what needs to be built to implement it.
2. Break down each user story into specific development tasks.
3. Document each development task with a clear description of what needs to be done.
4. Assign each task to a developer or team member responsible for completing it.
5. Track the progress of each task to ensure timely completion.
6. Once all tasks are completed, document the outcomes achieved for each user story.
7. Store this documentation in a central location for future reference and to aid in future development efforts.
The response to that prompt was: To document the development tasks and outcomes for future reference, follow these steps:

1. Task ID: Assign a unique identifier to each task for easy tracking and reference.
2. Task Title: Provide a clear and concise title for each task that accurately describes the work to be done.
3. Related User Story: Link each task to the corresponding user story or requirement that it addresses.
4. Description: Provide a detailed description of the task, including what needs to be done, why it is important, and any relevant information.
5. Acceptance Criteria: Clearly define the criteria that must be met for the task to be considered complete and accepted.
6. Estimated Effort: Provide an estimate of the effort required to complete each task, whether in hours, days, or other units of time.
7. Dependencies: Identify any dependencies that the task has on other tasks, resources, or external factors.

By following these steps and providing specific tasks with the required structure, you can effectively document the development tasks and outcomes for future reference.
It has been evaluated as incorrect.
Make only these corrections, do not alter content validity: To fix the answer, the worker agent should provide specific examples of development tasks following the exact structure outlined in the criteria. Each task should include the following details:

1. Task ID: A unique identifier for the task.
2. Task Title: A concise and descriptive title for the task.
3. Related User Story: The user story or requirement that the task is associated with.
4. Description: A detailed explanation of what needs to be done for the task.
5. Acceptance Criteria: The criteria that must be met for the task to be considered complete.
6. Estimated Effort: The amount of time or effort required to complete the task.
7. Dependencies: Any tasks, resources, or conditions that the task is dependent on.

By including these specific examples of tasks with all the required details, the answer will meet the criteria and provide a clear and structured approach to documenting development tasks.
Worker Agent Response:
To fix the answer, the worker agent should provide specific examples of development tasks following the exact structure outlined in the criteria. Each task should include the following details:

1. Task ID: T001
2. Task Title: Implement User Authentication
3. Related User Story: User should be able to log in and access personalized content.
4. Description: Develop a login page with email and password fields. Implement backend logic to authenticate user credentials.
5. Acceptance Criteria: User can successfully log in with valid credentials and access personalized dashboard.
6. Estimated Effort: 8 hours
7. Dependencies: Backend API for user management must be completed.

By including these specific examples of tasks with all the required details, the answer will meet the criteria and provide a clear and structured approach to documenting development tasks.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
